DevOps offline test
 
Record a 5 to 10 minute video showing how to setup a Jenkins deployment (with or without Spinnaker) that runs Terraform script to create resources on AWS (simple applications with ECS Cluster). In the video, include:
Explain your workflow and tools used, share you experience with CI/CD tools
Explain how the Jenkins script works
 
1.Provision AWS Resources using Terraform

          Set Up Networking

          Create IAM Roles and Policies

          Set Up Elastic Container Registry

          Create an ECS Cluster

          Configure Load Balance

            Deploy Jenkins

2. Set Up CI/CD Pipeline Using Jenkins

    Source Code Management

            Push application code to a GitHub.

            including DockerFile and jenkinsFile

      Build Docker Image

          Automate the build process using Jenkins.

            Push the built Docker image to ECR.

      Deploy Infrastructure:

            Use Terraform to define and deploy ECS resources.

      Deploy Application

          Update ECS services with the new Docker image, using a rolling update deployment strategy

Best Practices:

State Management: Store Terraform state files in a secure location like an S3 bucket with versioning enabled.

Secrets Management: Use tools like AWS Secrets Manager for managing sensitive information.

Terraform Versioning: Use a consistent Terraform version across your team.

Automated Rollbacks: Implement automated rollback strategies in case of deployment failures.
 
Please prepare this offline test using Free tier accounts, Before proceeding with next level of screening we need to shar this offline test assessment
 
the expectation is to deploy a sample Hello word application in ECS
 
Infra provisioning via Terraform Jenkins CICD pipeline, and also the application deployment should be also done via Jenkins CICD pipeline.
